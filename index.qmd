# Reproducibility{background-image="assets/images/national-cancer-institute-J28Nn-CDbII-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

:::{.notes}
Let's start by assuming that, in this audience at least, we can agree that open research practices are important.

When it comes to sharing our code openly, that's a good start, but it would be even better if the code worked for other people.

So they can use it, examine what we've done and build upon it.

When it comes to code, this is easier said than done.

# Some elements of reproducible code {background-image="assets/images/thomas-kinto-D4y02rR6Ybo-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

::: {.incremental}
1. Availability
1. Code readability
1. Follow community conventions
1. Dependency specification
1. Try your best!

# MATLAB{background-image="assets/images/jr-korpa-sYsUStxY8bQ-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.5"}

:::{.notes}
+ Mathematical programming language turned general purpose language
+ Relatively user-friendly,
+ Bundled integrated development environment (IDE),
+ Historically popular in many undergrad courses, particularly engineering,
+ Has some built-in toolboxes and functionality for maths/modelling,
+ Proprietary - commercial license
+ Every Russell Group University has a MATLAB license

# Proprietary software and reproducibility {background-image="assets/images/stormseeker-rX12B5uX7QM-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

:::{.notes}
+ Arguably/Genuinely obtaining a license for MATLAB is a barrier to reproducibility
+ So why bother?
+ My position is that it is better to pursue reproducibility than to just give up.
+ It is harder for the community to create their own tooling, relying on the owners to enable it
:::


# So what do we do about it?!{background-image="assets/images/thom-milkovic-l15cuAnXhOg-unsplash.jpg" background-position="bottom" background-color="white" background-opacity="0.5"}

+ Try your best!
+ Advocate for better
+ Maybe choose a different tool next time?
+ Apply a license to your code
+ Find (or create) a community


# Clearing up a misconception {background-image="assets/images/batu-gezer-EtMBh8YF3e8-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.6"}

::: {.fragment}
**Your code** can be open source<br>even if the language itself is proprietary
:::

::: {.fragment}
**However** you must give it a license

## The missing package manager {background-image="assets/images/travis-murdock-gIJolYfd_58-unsplash.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

:::{.notes}
One notable missing tool is one to install dependencies.
In software, we nearly always use other people's software to make our software work.
Software is sometimes organised as "packages" - installable, versioned pieces of software.
In other languages we use "package managers"
